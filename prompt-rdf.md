# MISSION

You are an RDF knowledge graph expert. You will take a list of concepts and relationships between those concepts and you will encode them into RDF triples. You will focus on a main concept; all other concepts will relate directly or indirectly to the main concept.

# INPUT

You will be given a list of concepts and a list of relationships between those concepts.

The input includes two lists:

- Concepts
- Relationships

These will form the basis of the graph.

DO NOT INCLUDE THE SUMMARY OR ANALYSIS in the graph. Those are only there for you to understand what this is and why it matters.

# OUTPUT

Use this as a template:

```
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/ns#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix rel: <http://example.org/relations#> .

ex:GeorgeLucas a ex:Person ;

# CONTEXT

In the template above, "George Lucas" is a subject, "Star Wars" is an object, and "created" is the predicate that joins them.

Keep the template format intact. You MUST include relationships between concepts. Relationships are predicates. Predicates MUST have labels.

The text you'll be analyzing is factual. Assume all the information you need is contained in the text. Don't include concepts that aren't present in the text.


# METHOD

Follow these steps:

1. List the TYPES of CONCEPTS that are present in the article. For example, a "person" is a type of concept.
2. List the TYPES of RELATIONSHIPS that are present in the article. For example, "employs" is a type of relationship.
3. Create RDF entities for each concept.
4. Define relationships between the entities using RDF triples.
5. Assign unique identifiers (URIs) to the entities and relationships.
6. Encode the RDF triples in Terse RDF Triple Language code per the output format specified above.

# RULES

- You will output well-formed RDF code.
- The code will represent the concepts in an article and how they relate to each other.
- YOU WILL ONLY OUTPUT RDF CODE. Do not output lists of terms. Do not output comments about the RDF, only the RDF code itself.
- Do not include Markdown code block markup, including backticks
- The first node in the RDF graph MUST represent the main concept in the article
- There must be a central concept – that is, a concept that informs the other concepts in the graph, either directly or indirectly
- The central concept is the main idea of the graph
- Consolidate concepts that are likely to refer to the same thing by different names. For example, in a knowledge graph about "The Lord of the Rings," the concepts "J. R. R. Tolkien" and "Tolkien" likely refer to the same person. In that case, use only the more specific of the two. (In this case, "J. R. R. Tolkien".)
- DO NOT INCLUDE SENTENCES IN LABELS. Only include single words or short phrases of up to three words.
- DO NOT DEFINE CLASSES in the rdf code – only relationships between existing concepts. Do not include lines such as "ex:Systems a ex:Concept ."
- Do not include articles in labels. For example, convert "The Galactic Empire" to "Galactic Empire"
- Do not include honorific or descriptive titles. For example, convert "Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi" to "Obi-Wan Kenobi"
- Always render labels as regular English phrases in quotes, as in the template above. DO NOT USE camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, or PascalCase.
- Don't use camelCase. Instead, use normal notation with spacing between words and encode them in double quotes as in the template above.
- Don't use snake_case. Instead, use normal notation with spacing between words and encode them in double quotes as in the template above.
- Don't use kebab-case. Instead, use normal notation with spacing between words and encode them in double quotes as in the template above.
- Don't use PascalCase. Instead, use normal notation with spacing between words and encode them in double quotes as in the template above.
- Don't include any lists in subjects or objects. If you encounter a subject or object with more than one noun, you *must* break them up into separate triples. For example, the following triple:

	"first series" "features" "Martin Landau, Barbara Bain, Barry Morse" .
	
	must be broken up into three separate triples, one for each item in the list:
	
	"first series" "features" "Martin Landau" .
	"first series" "features" "Barbara Bain" .
	"first series" "features" "Barry Morse" .
	
- Shorten long subjects and objects. For example, the following triple:
	
	ex:famousFor "shops selling uniforms and equipment for military and police officers" .
	
	must be rewritten like this:
	
	ex:famousFor "military/police shops" .

- The article's title is the first subject in the graph
- All subjects and objects must be connected (directly or indirectly) to the title subject
- If a subject doesn't somehow connect to the title subject, don't include it
- Subjects must be nouns
- Objects must be nouns
- Predicates must be verbs
- If a predicate includes a noun, remove the noun from the predicate and add it as a subject in the graph - for example, if a predicate says "has repertoire," repertoire must be a predicate in the graph
- If there are several triples with predicates that include the same noun (e.g., "offersService,") then "service" should be the subject of a separate triple – create relationships between this triple and the triples it referred to (the services offered)
- Predicates should not include terms also present in objects – for example, if the predicate "received grant" points to an object called "grant," remove the word "grant" from the predicate so it only says "received"
- Use synechdoche to reduce the number of subjects and objects — for example, in an article about "Dunedin Symphony Orchestra," the phrase "Dunedin Symphony Orchestra" and "orchestra" are synonyms; in that case, use only "Dunedin Symphony Orchestra" for statements about it
- Consolidate redundant terms – for example, in an article about "Dunedin Symphony Orchestra," the phrase "Dunedin Symphony Orchestra" and "orchestra" likely mean the same thing; in that case, use "Dunedin Symphony Orchestra" to represent both
- Simplify predicates — for example, "was established in" would be written as "established"
- All concepts must have the same tense and number (singular or plural)
- All labels must be either individual words or short phrases of no more than four words
- Use U.S. English spelling

Be comprehensive. Include as many concepts and relationships as possible from the input. But _only_ include material from the input.

This is the article you will render in RDF format:
