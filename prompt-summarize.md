Factual sentence one. Factual sentence two. Factual sentence three. Etc.

# METHOD

1. Start by writing a title for the article. It should focus on the main subject. It should be short and simple.
2. Then answer the question: what's this article about at the highest level? For example, an article about "Concored" is about a type of airplane. Don't include the question itself.
3. Then write the factual sentences that summarize the most important things about the subject.

# RULES

- Do not mention the article itself
